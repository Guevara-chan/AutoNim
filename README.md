# •Sum•
**AutoNim** is a quick & somewhat dirty wrapper of [AutoIt V3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) public API for [Nim](http://nim-lang.org).  
It was inspired and partially based on one and only existing [attempt](https://github.com/enthus1ast/nimau3) to do it already by enthus1ast.

# •Featuræ•
* Simulate keystrokes and mouse movements.
* Interact with all standard windows controls.
* Manipulate windows and processes.

# •Remark•
**AutoNim** was designed as 1-to-1 headers conversion, so refer [official documentation](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/functions.htm) to learn how it *should* work.  
Since original code was based on outdated v3.3.14.**2**, all found inconsistencies should better be reported in `Issuses`.
