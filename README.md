# •Sum•
**AutoNim** is a quick & somewhat dirty wrapper of [AutoIt V3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) public API for [Nim](http://nim-lang.org).  
It was inspired and partially based on one and only existing [attempt](https://github.com/enthus1ast/nimau3) to do it already by enthus1ast.

# •Remark•
Since **AutoNim** was designed as 1-to-1 headers conversion, refer [official documentation](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/functions.htm).
